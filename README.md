# Scheduling a conference using GPT-4 (4K)

Investigating whether GPT-4 has the ability to generate a single-day conference schedule that follows various constraints.

I've taken the public available [VoxxedDays Zurich](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/schedule/) conference schedule details including the accepted talks.

üëâüèº Published a [follow-up article](https://github.com/stephanj/Scheduling-using-GPT4-part-2) with a different (working) approach.

## Current situation

We currently use OptaPlanner to generate the schedule using different constraints.  More details about this approach can be seen in this Devoxx presentation.

[![Schedule Automation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GnnMHkY6vKk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnnMHkY6vKk)

## The constraints

HIGH CONSTRAINTS:

1. Use the talk summary to decide which talks should follow each other 
3. Don't use talks with the same tracks at the same time 
4. A speaker can't speak at different rooms during the same time
5. Only use the listed talks
6. List the talk id, from/to time, room name, title, speaker names, level and track name 

MEDIUM CONSTRAINTS:
1. Use markdown to list the generated schedule 

## The schedule info (CSV)

2. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Use the talk summary to decide which talks should follow each other 
3. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Don't have the same tracks at the same time. 
4. HIGH CONSTRAINT: A speaker can't speak at different rooms during the same time. 
5. List the talk id, from/to schedule time, room name, title, speaker names, level and track name 
6. Only use the listed talks! 
7. Use markdown to list the generated schedule

## Chained prompting approach

In this approach I have ***grouped all the talks per track*** and asked GPT per track to suggest an optimal order for the talks based on the semantic meaning of the talk.

In addition I've also asked to take in consideration the following soft constraints:
1. Topic relevance: Try to arrange the talks in a logical order, where each talk builds on the knowledge and concepts presented in the previous talk. 
2. Technical level: Considered the technical level of each talk (which is in the audienceLevel column)
3. Variety: Considered the variety of topics covered in the talks. 

The output per track was as follows :

    Development Practices: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914
    UI & UX: 4506, 4921, 3872
    Mind the Geek: 4372
    Server Side Java: 4918, 4505, 5464, 5487
    People & Culture: 4515
    Architecture: 5251, 4947, 4521
    Build & Deploy: 4913
    Java: 4945, 4931, 4929, 5456, 5261
    Security: 5298, 5268 

Per track the suggested GPT4 output was as follows:

``` 
---------------------------------------------------
Development Practices : 

Based on the factors mentioned, here is the suggested order for the talks:

1. "Let's talk about software behaviour (BDD)" (id: 4367) - This talk is a good starting point as it covers a beginner-level topic and introduces a useful concept (BDD) that can be applied in software development.

2. "Respect estimates" (id: 5259) - This talk builds on the previous one by discussing some of the common practices in software development and how they can be improved. It is still at a beginner level and provides some practical advice.

3. "Unit Test Your Java Architecture With ArchUnit" (id: 1411) - This talk introduces a more technical topic (unit testing) and is relevant to the development practices track. It also builds on the previous talk by emphasizing the importance of good testing practices.

4. "Monorepos - The Benefits, Challenges and Importance of Tooling Support" (id: 4914) - This talk is also relevant to the development practices track and introduces a more advanced topic (monorepos). It builds on the previous talk by discussing some of the challenges of managing large codebases and how monorepos can help.

The suggested order is: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914

Therefore, the comma delimited list of talk ids is: 4367,5259,1411,4914

...
``` 

For now, I manually took the suggested talks and copied them in a GPT-4 prompt:

```
Create me a conference schedule with following constraints: 
1. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Respect the order of the talk ids.  First id needs to be scheduled first etc. 
2. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Don't have the same tracks at the same time. 
3. List the talk id, from/to schedule time, room name, track name 
4. Only use the listed talks! 
5. Use markdown to list the generated schedule 

The schedule to populate is :

"from hour";"to hour";"room name"
"10:35";"11:20";Room 2 
"10:35";"11:20";Room 8
"10:35";"11:20";Room 7 
"10:35";"11:20";Room 3
"11:30";"12:15";Room 3
"11:30";"12:15";Room 8
"11:30";"12:15";Room 7
"11:30";"12:15";Room 2
"13:25";"14:10";Room 8
"13:25";"14:10";Room 7
"13:25";"14:10";Room 3

"15:25";"16:10";Room 7
"16:20";"17:05";Room 3
"16:20";"17:05";Room 2
"16:20";"17:05";Room 8
"16:20";"17:05";Room 7

The ordered talk ids per track:

    1. Development Practices: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914
    2. UI & UX: 4506, 4921, 3872
    3. Mind the Geek: 4372
    4. Server Side Java: 4918, 4505, 5464, 5487
    5. People & Culture: 4515
    6. Architecture: 5251, 4947, 4521
    7. Build & Deploy: 4913
    8. Java: 4945, 4931, 4929, 5456, 5261
    9. Security: 5298, 5268 

```

At least now GPT4 created a schedule following the order of the talks per track.

![Suggested schedule](https://github.com/stephanj/Scheduling-using-GPT4/raw/master/assets/gpt4-schedule.png)

However I've noticed that the constraint "Don't have the same tracks at the same time" was not met.  
Looks like I will need to enforce this a bit more through some extra "prompt engineering" (if possible). 

## Math approach

Convert the schedule info into a compact matrix representation. Easier to play with and less tokens.

So let's take the tracks and "sorted" talk id's: 

```
    1. Development Practices: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914
    2. UI & UX: 4506, 4921, 3872
    3. Mind the Geek: 4372
    4. Server Side Java: 4918, 4505, 5464, 5487
    5. People & Culture: 4515
    6. Architecture: 5251, 4947, 4521
    7. Build & Deploy: 4913
    8. Java: 4945, 4931, 4929, 5456, 5261
    9. Security: 5298, 5268 
```

Each track has it's own value, so 10 = Development Practices, 20 = UI & UX, etc. 

We multiply the track id sequence by 10,000 and add it to the talk id.

```
104367, 105259, 101411, 104914
204506, 204921, 203872

905298, 905268 
```

We also order the tracks with the most talks first etc.

```
804945, 804931, 804929, 805456, 805261
104367, 105259, 101411, 104914
404918, 404505, 405464, 405487
204506, 204921, 203872
605251, 604947, 604521
304372
504515
704913
```
BTW The order of the talk IDs are based on the semantic educational flow mentioned above.

The json array that we'll now play with looks as follows

```
sortedTalks = [
 {'sortedTalks': [804945, 804931, 804929, 805456, 805261]},  
  {'sortedTalks' : [104367, 105259, 101411, 104914]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [404918, 404505, 405464, 405487]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [204506, 204921, 203872]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [605251, 604947, 604521]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [905298, 905268]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [304372]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [504515]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [704913]}
]
```

Using the following GPT prompt with a secret context (for now) we get the expected result:

"Create a 6x4 matrix where each talk is listed in the order as they are provided per column. 
 In each matrix row a talk id can not be from the same track."

Generated the following "perfect" schedule ü•≥

## Conclusion

The explained approach is a totally acceptable strategy for a one-day conference, especially with the "education flow" analysis of the talk summaries. However scaling this to multiple days (like Devoxx Belgium) with extra hard & soft constraints is a challenge which (for now) can only be accomplished with additional code. 

The suggested talk order by GPT (based on the semantic analysis of talk summaries) is a great enhancement. Feeding this into OptaPlanner gives us ***the best of both worlds***.

## Addendum #1 (Sept '24)

Tried the same prompt with the brand new OpenAI o1-mini model, still no luck (13 Sept '24) :

**Notes:**

1. **Track Uniqueness:** Where conflicts in tracks occur within the same time slot, adjustments have been made to assign talks to different rooms to maintain track uniqueness. In cases where it's challenging, consider slight shifts in scheduling or room assignments.

2. **Educational Flow:** The schedule progresses from beginner to advanced topics, ensuring foundational talks are placed earlier, with more complex sessions following logically.

3. **Speaker Availability:** Each speaker is assigned to only one talk at any given time, adhering to availability constraints.

4. **Unassigned Slots:** If any slots remain unassigned due to constraints, they can be used for breaks, Q&A sessions, or networking opportunities.

---

This schedule ensures a balanced distribution of topics across all rooms and time slots, fostering an engaging and educational experience for all attendees.

## Addendum #2 (Apr '25)

I gave the same prompt to Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (reasoning) using https://aistudio.google.com and it returned a perfect schedule üòéüß†

---
Here's a breakdown of the thought process used to generate the conference schedule:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a valid conference schedule based on the provided room availability (schedule CSV) and talk details (talks CSV), adhering to several strict constraints. The output should be a markdown list detailing the schedule.

2.  **Identify the Inputs:**
    *   `schedule.csv`: Contains time slots and available rooms for each slot. Fields: "from hour", "to hour", "session type", "room name". All sessions are "Conference".
    *   `talks.csv`: Contains details about each talk. Fields: "Talk ID", "Talk Title", "Audience Level", "Talk Sumamry", "Track Name", "Speaker Availability days", "Available from", "Available to", "Speaker names". Note that the availability fields are empty, so we assume all speakers are available for all slots unless constrained otherwise.

3.  **Identify the Constraints:**
    *   **Constraint 1: Educational Flow (HIGH):** Talks should follow a logical sequence based on their summaries. This is subjective but important. It means grouping similar topics or having introductory talks before advanced ones within a track or related tracks if possible.
    *   **Constraint 2: Use Talk Summary for Flow (HIGH):** Reinforces Constraint 1. The content of the summary is key for deciding the order.
    *   **Constraint 3: No Same Tracks at the Same Time (HIGH):** In any given time slot, the tracks being presented across *all* rooms must be unique.
    *   **Constraint 4: Speaker Availability (HIGH):** A speaker cannot be in two places at once. (Although the input data doesn't show overlapping availability issues *per se*, this constraint ensures we don't assign the *same speaker* to two different talks in the *same time slot*).
    *   **Constraint 5: Output Format:** List specific fields (ID, time, room, title, speaker, level, track) in markdown.
    *   **Constraint 6: Use Only Listed Talks:** Don't invent talks.
    *   **Constraint 7: Markdown Output:** Format the final schedule using markdown lists.

4.  **Initial Data Processing & Analysis:**
    *   **Parse Schedule CSV:** Extract unique time slots and the rooms available in each slot.
        *   10:35-11:20: Room 2, Room 8, Room 7, Room 3 (4 rooms)
        *   11:30-12:15: Room 3, Room 8, Room 7, Room 2 (4 rooms)
        *   13:25-14:10: Room 8, Room 7, Room 3, Room 2 (4 rooms)
        *   14:20-15:05: Room 7, Room 8, Room 2, Room 3 (4 rooms)
        *   15:25-16:10: Room 3, Room 2, Room 8, Room 7 (4 rooms)
        *   16:20-17:05: Room 3, Room 2, Room 8, Room 7 (4 rooms)
        *   Total slots: 6. Total available talk slots: 6 * 4 = 24.
    *   **Parse Talks CSV:** Extract talk details, focusing on ID, Title, Summary, Track, Speaker, and Level.
        *   Count talks: There are 24 talks listed.
        *   Identify Tracks: Development Practices, UI & UX, Mind the Geek, Server Side Java, People & Culture, Architecture, Build & Deploy, Java, Security. (9 unique tracks).
        *   Identify Speakers: List unique speakers to easily check for conflicts (Constraint 4). (Roland Weisleder, Simon Martinelli, Katrin Rabow, Edoardo Vacchi, Alina Yurenko, Ruby Jane Cabagnot, Sven Peters, Anja Kunkel, Marit van Dijk, Juri Strumpflohner, √Ålvaro S√°nchez-Mariscal, Jonas Bandi, Edson Yanaga, Piotr Przybyl, Ana-Maria Mihalceanu, Urs Enzler, Sheen Brisals, Jarek Ratajski, Mario Fusco, Rotem Refael, Jamie Coleman, Nicolai Parlog, Oliver Drotbohm, Daniel Garnier-Moiroux). All speakers seem unique to their talks in this list.
    *   **Check Capacity:** 24 available slots and 24 talks. Perfect match. Every talk needs to be scheduled.

5.  **Scheduling Strategy (Iterative & Constraint-Driven):** This is the core challenge. Since "Educational Flow" is subjective and high priority, it needs careful consideration alongside the strict "No Same Tracks" constraint.

    *   **Step 1: Group by Track (Mental or Scratchpad):** Group talks by track to see potential flow within tracks.
        *   *Development Practices:* 1411 (ArchUnit), 4367 (BDD), 4914 (Monorepos), 5259 (Estimates)
        *   *UI & UX:* 3872 (Full-stack dead), 4506 (Qwik), 4921 (Reactivity Comparison)
        *   *Mind the Geek:* 4372 (Wasm)
        *   *Server Side Java:* 4505 (GraalVM Microservices), 4918 (Micronaut/GraalVM), 5464 (Spring Modulith), 5487 (Spring Security)
        *   *People & Culture:* 4515 (Developer Joy)
        *   *Architecture:* 4521 (Monolith->Microservices), 4947 (Evolutionary Arch), 5251 (Serverless Adoption)
        *   *Build & Deploy:* 4913 (Dependencies)
        *   *Java:* 4929 (Design Patterns Refactor), 4931 (Modern Java Features), 4945 (Performance Toolbox), 5261 (Loom), 5456 (Java Projects Amber/Loom etc.)
        *   *Security:* 5268 (K8s Scan), 5298 (SBOMs)

    *   **Step 2: Prioritize Tracks with Potential Flow:**
        *   *Java:* Seems like a good candidate. 4945 (Perf Intro) -> 4931 (Modern Features) -> 4929 (Patterns Refactor) -> 5261 (Loom Adv) -> 5456 (Big Projects Adv). This is a potential sequence.
        *   *Server Side Java:* 4918 (Micronaut Intro) -> 4505 (GraalVM Microservices) -> 5487 (Spring Security) -> 5464 (Spring Modulith Adv). Another potential sequence.
        *   *Architecture:* 4947 (Evolutionary Arch) -> 5251 (Serverless) -> 4521 (Monolith->Micro).
        *   *Development Practices:* 4367 (BDD Intro) -> 1411 (ArchUnit) -> 4914 (Monorepos) -> 5259 (Estimates Critique).
        *   *UI & UX:* 4506 (Qwik Intro) -> 3872 (Full-stack) -> 4921 (Reactivity Compare).
        *   *Security:* 5298 (SBOM Intro) -> 5268 (K8s Scan).

    *   **Step 3: Start Filling Time Slots (Trial and Error):** This involves picking a time slot and assigning 4 talks, checking constraints.

        *   **Slot 1 (10:35-11:20):** Need 4 *different* tracks. Let's try starting some sequences.
            *   Room 2: 4367 (BDD - Dev Prac - BEGINNER) - Good start.
            *   Room 8: 4506 (Qwik - UI/UX - BEGINNER) - Good start.
            *   Room 7: 4945 (Java Perf - Java - BEGINNER) - Good start.
            *   Room 3: 5298 (SBOM - Security - BEGINNER) - Good start.
            *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Dev Prac, UI/UX, Java, Security) are unique. Speakers are unique. Flow seems okay (all beginner intros). OK.

        *   **Slot 2 (11:30-12:15):** Need 4 different tracks, different from each other, and ideally continuing the flow.
            *   Room 3: 1411 (ArchUnit - Dev Prac - BEGINNER) - Follows 4367 somewhat.
            *   Room 8: 3872 (Full-stack - UI/UX - INTERMEDIATE) - Follows 4506.
            *   Room 7: 4931 (Modern Java - Java - INTERMEDIATE) - Follows 4945.
            *   Room 2: 4918 (Micronaut - Server Side Java - BEGINNER) - New track start.
            *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Dev Prac, UI/UX, Java, Server Side Java) are unique. Speakers unique. Flow is maintained within tracks started in Slot 1, introduces Server Side Java. OK.

        *   **Slot 3 (13:25-14:10):**
            *   Room 8: 4914 (Monorepos - Dev Prac - BEGINNER) - Continues Dev Prac.
            *   Room 7: 4921 (Reactivity - UI/UX - INTERMEDIATE) - Continues UI/UX.
            *   Room 3: 4929 (Design Patterns - Java - INTERMEDIATE) - Continues Java.
            *   Room 2: 4505 (GraalVM Microservices - Server Side Java - INTERMEDIATE) - Continues Server Side Java.
            *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Dev Prac, UI/UX, Java, Server Side Java) unique. Speakers unique. Flow maintained. OK.

        *   **Slot 4 (14:20-15:05):** Need 4 different tracks. What's left? Architecture, Build & Deploy, Mind the Geek, People & Culture, more Java, Server Side, Security, Dev Prac.
            *   Room 7: 5259 (Estimates - Dev Prac - BEGINNER) - Finishes Dev Prac track.
            *   Room 8: 5268 (K8s Scan - Security - BEGINNER) - Continues Security track.
            *   Room 2: 5261 (Loom - Java - ADVANCED) - Continues Java track (advanced).
            *   Room 3: 5487 (Spring Security - Server Side Java - INTERMEDIATE) - Continues Server Side Java.
            *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Dev Prac, Security, Java, Server Side Java) unique. Speakers unique. Flow okay. OK.

        *   **Slot 5 (15:25-16:10):** Need 4 different tracks. Remaining: Architecture (3), Build & Deploy (1), Mind the Geek (1), People & Culture (1), Java (1), Server Side Java (1). Need to pick 4.
            *   Room 3: 4947 (Evolutionary Arch - Architecture - INTERMEDIATE) - Start Arch track.
            *   Room 2: 4913 (Dependencies - Build & Deploy - BEGINNER) - Start B&D track.
            *   Room 8: 5456 (Java Next - Java - ADVANCED) - Finishes Java track (advanced).
            *   Room 7: 5464 (Spring Modulith - Server Side Java - ADVANCED) - Finishes Server Side Java track (advanced).
            *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Architecture, Build & Deploy, Java, Server Side Java) unique. Speakers unique. Flow okay (finishing Java/Server Side, starting Arch/B&D). OK.

        *   **Slot 6 (16:20-17:05):** Need 4 different tracks. Remaining: Architecture (2), Mind the Geek (1), People & Culture (1). Have 4 rooms. Perfect.
            *   Room 3: 5251 (Serverless - Architecture - BEGINNER) - Continues Arch.
            *   Room 2: 4521 (Monolith->Micro - Architecture - ADVANCED) - Continues Arch. *Wait!* Constraint 3: No same tracks at the same time. This doesn't work.

        *   **Step 4: Backtrack & Adjust (Slot 5 & 6):** The issue arose because we ran out of diverse tracks for the last slots, forcing Architecture twice in Slot 6. Let's re-evaluate Slot 5.
            *   *Alternative Slot 5 (15:25-16:10):* Let's spread out the remaining tracks better.
                *   Room 3: 4947 (Evolutionary Arch - Architecture - INTERMEDIATE) - Start Arch.
                *   Room 2: 4913 (Dependencies - Build & Deploy - BEGINNER) - Start B&D.
                *   Room 8: 4372 (Wasm - Mind the Geek - INTERMEDIATE) - Start Mind the Geek.
                *   Room 7: 4515 (Developer Joy - People & Culture - INTERMEDIATE) - Start People & Culture.
                *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Arch, B&D, Mind the Geek, People & Culture) unique. Speakers unique. Flow okay (starts several single-talk tracks). OK.
            *   *Try Slot 6 again (16:20-17:05):* Remaining: Architecture (2), Java (1), Server Side Java (1). We still need 4 *different* tracks. Ah, I miscounted what was left before. Let's re-list remaining talks after the *original* Slot 4:
                *   Architecture: 4521, 4947, 5251
                *   Build & Deploy: 4913
                *   Mind the Geek: 4372
                *   People & Culture: 4515
                *   Java: 5456
                *   Server Side Java: 5464
                *   Total: 8 talks left for 8 slots (2 time slots * 4 rooms).
            *   *Retry Slot 5 (15:25-16:10):* Need 4 different tracks from the 8 remaining.
                *   Room 3: 4947 (Evolutionary Arch - Architecture - INTERMEDIATE)
                *   Room 2: 4913 (Dependencies - Build & Deploy - BEGINNER)
                *   Room 8: 5456 (Java Next - Java - ADVANCED) - Finishes Java track.
                *   Room 7: 5464 (Spring Modulith - Server Side Java - ADVANCED) - Finishes Server Side Java track.
                *   *Check Constraints:* Tracks (Arch, B&D, Java, Server Side Java) unique. Speakers unique. Flow okay. OK.
            *   *Retry Slot 6 (16:20-17:05):* Remaining: Architecture (4521, 5251), Mind the Geek (4372), People & Culture (4515). Four talks, four rooms, three unique tracks. *Still doesn't work due to two Architecture talks.*

        *   **Step 5: Major Re-evaluation:** The "No Same Track" constraint is hard, especially with multiple talks in the same track (Java has 5, Server Side Java has 4, Dev Prac has 4, Arch has 3, UI/UX has 3). It's mathematically difficult to avoid track collisions if you try to keep *all* talks of a popular track contiguous. The "Educational Flow" might need to be slightly less strict *within* a track (i.e., a track might be split across non-adjacent time slots) to satisfy the "No Same Track" constraint.

        *   **Step 6: Re-attempt Scheduling with Relaxed Intra-Track Flow:** Let's prioritize avoiding track collisions *per slot*.
            *   **Slot 1 (10:35-11:20):** (Keep previous attempt - seemed good)
                *   Room 2: 4367 (BDD - Dev Prac - BEGINNER)

                *   *Tracks: Dev Prac, UI/UX, Java, Server Side Java (OK)*

            *   **Slot 6 (16:20-17:05):** Need 4 different tracks. Available: Java(1 - 5456), ServerSide(1 - 5464), Arch(1 - 4521), PeopleCulture(1 - 4515). Perfect!
                *   Room 3: 5456 (Java Next - Java - ADVANCED)

                *   *Tracks: Java, Server Side Java, Arch, People & Culture (OK)*

    *   **Step 7: Final Review:** Check all constraints again for the generated schedule.
        *   Flow: Seems reasonable. Beginner talks tend to be earlier. Tracks like Java, Dev Prac, UI/UX, Server Side Java have multiple sessions, somewhat spread out but often following each other logically (e.g., Java Perf -> Modern Java -> Design Patterns -> Loom -> Java Next; Micronaut -> GraalVM -> Spring Security -> Spring Modulith). It's a compromise, but better than violating the track constraint.
        *   Track Collision: Double-checked each time slot; tracks are unique within each slot.
        *   Speaker Conflict: All speakers only appear once, so no conflict.
        *   All Talks Used: Yes, 24 talks scheduled.
        *   Output Format: Need to format as markdown list with requested fields.

6.  **Generate Markdown Output:** Go through the final schedule slot by slot, room by room, and format the output according to Constraint 5.
