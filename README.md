# Scheduling a conference using GPT-4 (4K)

Investigating whether GPT-4 has the ability to generate a single-day conference schedule that follows various constraints.

I've taken the public available [VoxxedDays Zurich](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/schedule/) conference schedule details including the accepted talks.

üëâüèº Published a [follow-up article](https://github.com/stephanj/Scheduling-using-GPT4-part-2) with a different (working) approach.

## Current situation

We currently use OptaPlanner to generate the schedule using different constraints.  More details about this approach can be seen in this Devoxx presentation.

[![Schedule Automation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GnnMHkY6vKk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnnMHkY6vKk)

## The constraints

HIGH CONSTRAINTS:

1. Use the talk summary to decide which talks should follow each other 
3. Don't use talks with the same tracks at the same time 
4. A speaker can't speak at different rooms during the same time
5. Only use the listed talks
6. List the talk id, from/to time, room name, title, speaker names, level and track name 

MEDIUM CONSTRAINTS:
1. Use markdown to list the generated schedule 

## The schedule info (CSV)

2. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Use the talk summary to decide which talks should follow each other 
3. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Don't have the same tracks at the same time. 
4. HIGH CONSTRAINT: A speaker can't speak at different rooms during the same time. 
5. List the talk id, from/to schedule time, room name, title, speaker names, level and track name 
6. Only use the listed talks! 
7. Use markdown to list the generated schedule

## Chained prompting approach

In this approach I have ***grouped all the talks per track*** and asked GPT per track to suggest an optimal order for the talks based on the semantic meaning of the talk.

In addition I've also asked to take in consideration the following soft constraints:
1. Topic relevance: Try to arrange the talks in a logical order, where each talk builds on the knowledge and concepts presented in the previous talk. 
2. Technical level: Considered the technical level of each talk (which is in the audienceLevel column)
3. Variety: Considered the variety of topics covered in the talks. 

The output per track was as follows :

    Development Practices: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914
    UI & UX: 4506, 4921, 3872
    Mind the Geek: 4372
    Server Side Java: 4918, 4505, 5464, 5487
    People & Culture: 4515
    Architecture: 5251, 4947, 4521
    Build & Deploy: 4913
    Java: 4945, 4931, 4929, 5456, 5261
    Security: 5298, 5268 

Per track the suggested GPT4 output was as follows:

``` 
---------------------------------------------------
Development Practices : 

Based on the factors mentioned, here is the suggested order for the talks:

1. "Let's talk about software behaviour (BDD)" (id: 4367) - This talk is a good starting point as it covers a beginner-level topic and introduces a useful concept (BDD) that can be applied in software development.

2. "Respect estimates" (id: 5259) - This talk builds on the previous one by discussing some of the common practices in software development and how they can be improved. It is still at a beginner level and provides some practical advice.

3. "Unit Test Your Java Architecture With ArchUnit" (id: 1411) - This talk introduces a more technical topic (unit testing) and is relevant to the development practices track. It also builds on the previous talk by emphasizing the importance of good testing practices.

4. "Monorepos - The Benefits, Challenges and Importance of Tooling Support" (id: 4914) - This talk is also relevant to the development practices track and introduces a more advanced topic (monorepos). It builds on the previous talk by discussing some of the challenges of managing large codebases and how monorepos can help.

The suggested order is: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914

Therefore, the comma delimited list of talk ids is: 4367,5259,1411,4914

...
``` 

For now, I manually took the suggested talks and copied them in a GPT-4 prompt:

```
Create me a conference schedule with following constraints: 
1. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Respect the order of the talk ids.  First id needs to be scheduled first etc. 
2. HIGH CONSTRAINT: Don't have the same tracks at the same time. 
3. List the talk id, from/to schedule time, room name, track name 
4. Only use the listed talks! 
5. Use markdown to list the generated schedule 

The schedule to populate is :

"from hour";"to hour";"room name"
"10:35";"11:20";Room 2 
"10:35";"11:20";Room 8
"10:35";"11:20";Room 7 
"10:35";"11:20";Room 3
"11:30";"12:15";Room 3
"11:30";"12:15";Room 8
"11:30";"12:15";Room 7
"11:30";"12:15";Room 2
"13:25";"14:10";Room 8
"13:25";"14:10";Room 7
"13:25";"14:10";Room 3

"15:25";"16:10";Room 7
"16:20";"17:05";Room 3
"16:20";"17:05";Room 2
"16:20";"17:05";Room 8
"16:20";"17:05";Room 7

The ordered talk ids per track:

    1. Development Practices: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914
    2. UI & UX: 4506, 4921, 3872
    3. Mind the Geek: 4372
    4. Server Side Java: 4918, 4505, 5464, 5487
    5. People & Culture: 4515
    6. Architecture: 5251, 4947, 4521
    7. Build & Deploy: 4913
    8. Java: 4945, 4931, 4929, 5456, 5261
    9. Security: 5298, 5268 

```

At least now GPT4 created a schedule following the order of the talks per track.

![Suggested schedule](https://github.com/stephanj/Scheduling-using-GPT4/raw/master/assets/gpt4-schedule.png)

However I've noticed that the constraint "Don't have the same tracks at the same time" was not met.  
Looks like I will need to enforce this a bit more through some extra "prompt engineering" (if possible). 

## Math approach

Convert the schedule info into a compact matrix representation. Easier to play with and less tokens.

So let's take the tracks and "sorted" talk id's: 

```
    1. Development Practices: 4367, 5259, 1411, 4914
    2. UI & UX: 4506, 4921, 3872
    3. Mind the Geek: 4372
    4. Server Side Java: 4918, 4505, 5464, 5487
    5. People & Culture: 4515
    6. Architecture: 5251, 4947, 4521
    7. Build & Deploy: 4913
    8. Java: 4945, 4931, 4929, 5456, 5261
    9. Security: 5298, 5268 
```

Each track has it's own value, so 10 = Development Practices, 20 = UI & UX, etc. 

We multiply the track id sequence by 10,000 and add it to the talk id.

```
104367, 105259, 101411, 104914
204506, 204921, 203872

905298, 905268 
```

We also order the tracks with the most talks first etc.

```
804945, 804931, 804929, 805456, 805261
104367, 105259, 101411, 104914
404918, 404505, 405464, 405487
204506, 204921, 203872
605251, 604947, 604521
304372
504515
704913
```
BTW The order of the talk IDs are based on the semantic educational flow mentioned above.

The json array that we'll now play with looks as follows

```
sortedTalks = [
 {'sortedTalks': [804945, 804931, 804929, 805456, 805261]},  
  {'sortedTalks' : [104367, 105259, 101411, 104914]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [404918, 404505, 405464, 405487]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [204506, 204921, 203872]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [605251, 604947, 604521]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [905298, 905268]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [304372]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [504515]},
  {'sortedTalks' : [704913]}
]
```

Using the following GPT prompt with a secret context (for now) we get the expected result:

"Create a 6x4 matrix where each talk is listed in the order as they are provided per column. 
 In each matrix row a talk id can not be from the same track."

Generated the following "perfect" schedule ü•≥

## Conclusion

The explained approach is a totally acceptable strategy for a one-day conference, especially with the "education flow" analysis of the talk summaries. However scaling this to multiple days (like Devoxx Belgium) with extra hard & soft constraints is a challenge which (for now) can only be accomplished with additional code. 

The suggested talk order by GPT (based on the semantic analysis of talk summaries) is a great enhancement. Feeding this into OptaPlanner gives us ***the best of both worlds***.

## Addendum

Tried the same prompt with the brand new OpenAI o1-mini model, still no luck (13 Sept '24) :

### Prompt response: 

Below is the **Conference Schedule** organized to ensure a great educational flow, logical progression based on talk summaries, and adherence to all specified constraints.

**Notes:**

1. **Track Uniqueness:** Where conflicts in tracks occur within the same time slot, adjustments have been made to assign talks to different rooms to maintain track uniqueness. In cases where it's challenging, consider slight shifts in scheduling or room assignments.

2. **Educational Flow:** The schedule progresses from beginner to advanced topics, ensuring foundational talks are placed earlier, with more complex sessions following logically.

3. **Speaker Availability:** Each speaker is assigned to only one talk at any given time, adhering to availability constraints.

4. **Unassigned Slots:** If any slots remain unassigned due to constraints, they can be used for breaks, Q&A sessions, or networking opportunities.

This schedule ensures a balanced distribution of topics across all rooms and time slots, fostering an engaging and educational experience for all attendees.
